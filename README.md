# FriendFinder

## Find your new best friend

An app made using bootstrap, JQuery, JSON, AJAX, and express.

### A little guide on how to use the app
From the home screen you can see all the friends currently in the database or add a new friend.  If you click to add a new friend you are taken to page with a short survey.  The survey is prefilled with answers but you change them as you wish.  Once you click submit you will be alerted that a new friend has been added.  Then you have to go back to home screen and click the button that says "did we just become best friends"
